# Volte's Avalonia UI

This UI built with Avalonia and FluentAvalonia, and is a direct modification of the UI of the [Tears of the Kingdom Mod Merger](https://github.com/TKMM-Team/Tkmm/).<br/>
Obviously Volte has no mod merging functionality, so what it's using is basically just TKMM's styling & instrumentation code.
